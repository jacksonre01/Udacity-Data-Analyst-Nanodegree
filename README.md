# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a portfolio of my work associated with the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.  
A brief overview of the goal of each project and the primary tools used.  The individual notebook or markdown files each  
contain a project overview or introduction providing additonal project context.

## Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data
**Goal:** Apply Python programming fundamentals such as data types and structures, variables, loops, and functions.  
**Tools Used:** Python, MatplotLib, Pandas, Numpy

## Project: Investigate a Dataset
**Goal:** Apply the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Learn how to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.  
**Tools Used:** Python, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy

## Project: Analyze A/B Test Results
**Goal:** Apply inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.  
**Tools Used:** Scipy.stats, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, Regression

## Project: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
**Goal:** Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.  
**Tools Used:** Scipy.stats, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy

## Project: Explore and Summarize Data 
**Goal:** Explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations, acquire statistical knowledge for summarizing data, and develop intuition around a data set.  
**Tools Used:** R, R Studio, ggplot2, R Markdown  
**_Note: use the RMD to view code and the MD to view the EDA visualizations._**

## Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data
**Goal:** Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn how to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis.  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Regular Expressions, Twitter API

## Project: Create a Tableau Story
**Goal:** Apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process. Learn how to use analysis and visualizations to tell a story with data.  
**Tools Used:** Tableau (Python, Pandas, Numpy for initial Data Wrangling)
